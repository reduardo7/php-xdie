php-xdie | PHP XDIE
===================

# Description

It is a PHP function to help a PHP developer, used for debug a PHP script insted of "print_r" or "var_export".

Using this function, you can see a "HTML" with details, and a readable text in console.

Is ideal when you do not have a Framework or another utility to help us in the development, and we need
a simple way to "simple" to analyze some variables.
